## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if there exists a triple of indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`.  
If no such indices exist, return `false`.

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10⁵`  
- `-2³¹ <= nums[i] <= 2³¹ - 1`

---

## Follow-up

Could you implement a solution that runs in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity?
