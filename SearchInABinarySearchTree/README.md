# Search in a Binary Search Tree

**Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/description/)

---

## Description

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`.  
Find the node in the BST whose value equals `val`, and return the subtree rooted with that node.  
If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5000]`  
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10⁷`  
- `root` is a binary search tree  
- `1 <= val <= 10⁷`
