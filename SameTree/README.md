# Same Tree

**Problem link:** [LeetCode - Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree)

## Description

Given two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same.  
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### Example

- Input:  
  `p = [1,2,3]`,  
  `q = [1,2,3]`  
  â†’ Output: `true`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
