## Description

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree in left-to-right order. The values of these leaves form a leaf value sequence.

Two binary trees are considered **leaf-similar** if their leaf value sequences are the same.

Given two binary trees with root nodes `root1` and `root2`, return `true` if they are leaf-similar, and `false` otherwise.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 200]`  
- Each tree node's value is in the range `[0, 200]`
