## Description

Given a 0-indexed `n x n` integer matrix `grid`, return the number of pairs `(ri, cj)` such that row `ri` and column `cj` are equal.

A row and column pair is considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order (i.e., they form an equal array).

## Constraints

- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`  
- `1 <= n <= 200`  
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10⁵`
