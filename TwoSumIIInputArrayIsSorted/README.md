# Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted

**Problem link:** [LeetCode - Two Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted)

## Description

Given a sorted array of integers `numbers` and a target integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.  
The solution must use constant extra space and the indices returned must be 1-based.

### Example

- Input: `numbers = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9` → Output: `[1,2]`  
  (Because `numbers[0] + numbers[1] == 9`)

## Constraints

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= numbers[i] <= 10^9`
- `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order
- Exactly one solution exists
