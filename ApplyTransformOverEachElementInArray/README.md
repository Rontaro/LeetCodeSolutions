## Description

Given an integer array `arr` and a mapping function `fn`, return a new array with a transformation applied to each element.

The returned array should be created such that `returnedArray[i] = fn(arr[i], i)`.

Please solve it without the built-in `Array.map` method.

## Constraints

- `0 <= arr.length <= 1000`  
- `-10⁹ <= arr[i] <= 10⁹`  
- `fn` returns an integer.
