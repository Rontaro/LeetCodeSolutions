# Product of Array Except Self

## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`  
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`  
- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

---

## Follow-up

Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity?  
(The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
